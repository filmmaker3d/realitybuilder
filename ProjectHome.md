## Introduction ##

The Reality Builder allows anyone on the web to direct the construction of a physical structure. It is a web application that shows a webcam image of a construction. Overlaid on that image is a virtual building block that the user may position: [augmented reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality). The construction team works with the application via a web-based administration interface.

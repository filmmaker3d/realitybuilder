# Initializes the datastore with sample data.
#
# Possibilities to execute the code in this file:
#
# * GAE SDK 1.5 or compatible: Paste the code in the interactive console and
#   execute it.
# 
# * GAE (production):
# 
#   a) Enter the directory of the Reality Builder.
#
#   b) Connect to the remote API shell.
# 
#     On Windows XP's "cmd.exe" (substitute %-placeholders):
#
#       %PYTHON_PATH%\python.exe %GAE_PATH%\remote_api_shell.py -s ^
#       %VERSION%.%APPLICATION%.appspot.com
#
#     Note that, despite specifying a version above, the same datastore as for
#     all other versions is used: There is only one.
#
#   c) Paste the code and press enter. It will execute automatically.
